### Summary  
- Prosper is Americaâ€™s first marketplace lending platform, with over $8 billion in funded loans. for more information visit [Prosper.com](https://www.prosper.com/).     
- Based on the published loan data, I extracted the number of loans made from each state. [data/borrower_states.csv].
- the company should pay attention to states with high number of loans, but what if these states already have very high number of population!, for this reason I created a new variable called "score" to give each state a score this score is computed by summing (loans/population) and (loans/total_loans) per state then map the values to a value between 0 and 1.  
- Thus states with higher score means that these states have both high number of loans and high number of population which make them worth paying attention to.  
->As shown in the map below, the three states: California, Illinois, and Georgia have score higher than 0.7, moreover, 18 states have score higher than 0.5.

### Design
- As the data describes the states of America so a map would be the best way to show it.  
- Using the geographic data: [data/us-states-geo.json] I draw the map.  
- Also I added color palette to show the difference in values between different states.  
- And an interactive table of information, filters and summary, which leaves to the user the freedom to explore the visualization and get his own conclusions.  
- most of the color used are black and white except for the color palette I used colors from black, blues and white, as you can easily notice that black is higher than blue and blue is higher than white.
